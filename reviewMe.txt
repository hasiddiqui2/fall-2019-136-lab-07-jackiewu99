Person that review me: Imtiaz

When looking at the funcs.cpp file, I see an organized layout of functions.
Each of them having critical values when it comes to manipulating the input
the program receives. For the main.cpp it would be helpful to see if
multi-line input would work though I see it in the unindent function, so
slightly confused there. Overall the code seems concise and working for the
task assigned. He also took a different approach and made the function call
inside of another function for task B.
