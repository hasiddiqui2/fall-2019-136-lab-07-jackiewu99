Person Being Reviewed: Derek


Derek's code worked and he had made similar choices like me. For instance
he used to test everything through main instead of making a test file. Our
makefiles were similar and basically functioned the same as eachother. One
big difference I noticed was his choice on reading the file. The user had
to manually input the file useing "<" rather than fin stream to read the
file while the code ran. There were also some minor different things we did
such as what functions went into main.cpp and funcs.cpp but at the end our
codes both functioned the same way.
